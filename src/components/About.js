        <h2>Mashed Potatoes: Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Mashed Potatoes!

          In an age where media is increasingly moving to a digital only distribution model and physical releases are getting rarer, 
          questions arise regarding whether consumers actually own the media they 'purchase'. According to Steam, when you die, your account
          is effectively gone; it is not legal for anyone else to obtain your credentials and use the products purchased under their account. 
          <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/">Don't take our word for it, check this source.</a>

          According to the Federal Trade Commission, <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2024/04/do-you-really-own-digital-items-you-paid">many End User License Agreements (EULAs)</a> 
          guarantee access only to a license for the digital product you paid for, meaning that if it is ever revoked, you can no longer access that piece of media,
          at least in the format in which you paid for it.
